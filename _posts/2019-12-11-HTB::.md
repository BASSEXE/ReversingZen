#LAME
## Summary:
    
   Lame is a beginner level box, that is a great introduction for those new to the platform.  Through some basic enumeration, a Vulnerable version of Samba 3.0 is being used for SMB services.   Described in CVE-2007-2447
attackers can remotely execute code by injecting shell meta characters through ‘SamrChangePassword’ when supplied with  ‘username map script’(Ref CVE-2007-2447).  This vulnerability is found within organizations using MS-RPC   for printer and file share management.  This exploit can be found both within Metasploit and Exploit-DB under EDB-ID: 16320(link to EDB ref.)


## NMAP

We start this box with Nmap enumeration to discover any open services that may be running.
`Nmap -sV -sC 10.10.10.3 —version-all -Pn`
Ports 21(FTP), 22(SSH), 139(SMB), 445(SMB) are all reported as open on LAME.  Specifically, SAMBA 3.02 is seen running on port 445 which is exposed to a command execution vulnerability in versions preceding SAMBA 3.025.  
![Nmap Scan](https://github.com/BASSEXE/ReversingZen/blob/gh-pages/assets/img/Nmap%20Scan.png?raw=true)
This vulnerability is leveraged through SAMBA’s “failure to properly filter out input to /bin/sh”(www.kbe.cert.org/vuls/id/268336), allowing actors to bypass authentication and simultaneously granting root privileges.

## METASPLOIT
The Metasploit framework provides an excellent module that leverages exploit effortlessly under
`exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script`

## RUNNING usermap_script MODULE
Supplying the module with LAME’s IP address and running the exploit accordingly quickly produces a shell with root privileges.

Capturing the root.txt flag is simple with basic Linux directory navigation.

## EPILOGUE
The main vector for exploitation of this vulnerability is unpatched and outdated software running on production machines.  Carnegie Mellon University recommends:
1. Patch or Upgrade versions of SAMBA below 3.025
2. Disallow external shell scripts
3. Restrict access of unpatched systems to trusted hosts.
